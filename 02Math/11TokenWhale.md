<p>

* The ```transferFrom()``` function takes the token amount from who starts the transfer.
* All you have to do is approve another wallet to spend a crazy amount.
* Then switch to that wallet and ```transferFrom()`` your initial wallet and a random 3rd wallet.
* Now send 1000000 to the initial wallet.
