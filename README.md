# Capture The Ether Walkthrough
**NOT DONE YET WILL UPDATE AS I GO** <br></br>
Here is a walkthrough for [Capture The Ether challenges.](https://capturetheether.com/) Would highly recommend that you do it on your own until you want to smash your monitors. **DON'T, smash your monitor** then come back to this for help getting unstuck and go back to figure out the next parts.
<br></br>

* **Notes:** You will need test ether for the ropsten Test Network. You can get some [here.](https://faucet.ropsten.be/) (Only gives 0.3 ether every 10 seconds). There are other ones but I can never get them to work or get into queue.
    * For Some of the challenges you can just copy/paste the contract into the Remix IDE and deploy at you instance address
    * The address I completed these challenges at is: ```0x714Af4c78135Ec866a3cd34755BDB59cdb9b7246```
    * Username on the scoreboard is: ```@PostMan56```
